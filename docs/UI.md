### 🧩 Design Guidelines

#### 🔹 Layout & Structure
- Use **clean, minimal, and responsive layouts** with consistent spacing (Tailwind utilities).  
- Follow a **card-based grid design** for user profiles, mentorship listings, and dashboards.  
- Maintain **clear visual hierarchy** — primary actions first, secondary actions grouped logically.  
- Use **Shadcn/UI components** for inputs, modals, alerts, and dashboards to maintain consistency.

#### 🔹 Color & Theme
- Primary palette: your company’s color theme  
- Secondary: neutral grays for contrast and balance  
- Use soft gradients or shadows for depth, but maintain **modern flat design principles**.  
- Ensure **color contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1** for text and UI elements.

#### 🔹 Typography
- Use **Sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter, Poppins, or Satoshi)** for readability.  
- Maintain font scale consistency:
  - Headings: `text-2xl` / `text-xl`
  - Body: `text-base`
  - Captions/Labels: `text-sm`

#### 🔹 UX Flow
- **Onboarding:** Multi-step, progressive, and visually guided.  
- **Mentorship:** Simple “Request Mentor” CTA → confirmation modal → chat entry.  
- **Admin Verification:** Clean dashboard with ID previews and approve/reject buttons.  
- **Chat System:** Familiar layout with avatars, timestamps, and typing indicators.  
- **Job Posting:** Minimal form UI; focus on clarity over complexity.

#### 🔹 Accessibility
- Use `aria-*` attributes on all interactive components.  
- Keyboard navigation support for every element.  
- Use focus rings for buttons and inputs.  
- Ensure form fields have labels and helper text.

#### 🔹 Microinteractions
- Smooth hover effects, button feedback, and transitions.  
- Use **Framer Motion** or **Tailwind’s transition utilities** for subtle animations.  
- Keep animations under 200ms for responsiveness.
